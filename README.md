This repository contains the explorative analysis conducted in R for the bayesian models.
In the stan_models folder the different types of stan models can be found. They differenciate between the model specifications and the use-case (posterior predicitve, prior predicitve checks etc.)
In the stan_driver folder are the R files to call the models in stan_models. The exact path may have to be updated yet.
